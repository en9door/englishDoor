## Lesson 2 - CyclicRotation

An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted<br>
right by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For example,<br> 
the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the first place).<br>
The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.<br>
Write a function:<br>
class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A, int K); }<br>
that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.<br>
For example, given<br>
    A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]<br>
    K = 3<br>
the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:<br>
    [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]<br>
    [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]<br>
    [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]<br>
For another example, given<br>
    A = [0, 0, 0]<br>
    K = 1<br>
the function should return [0, 0, 0]<br>
Given<br>
    A = [1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
    K = 4<br>
the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
Assume that:<br>
* N and K are integers within the range [0..100];<br>
* each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].<br>
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
<br>

### Code

```
public static int[] solution(int[] A, int K){
		
		int[] B = new int[A.length];
		
		int length = A.length;
		
		for(int i = 0 ; i < length ; i++){
			B[(i + K) % length] = A[i];
		}
		
		return B;
}
```
